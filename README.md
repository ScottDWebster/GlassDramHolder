# GlassDramHolder
An <a href=http://www.openscad.org/>OpenSCAD</a> design for a holder for a 4 dram glass vial. (See also http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2252675)

I needed a base to hold a <a href=https://www.containerstore.com/s/glass-dram-vials/d?productId=10008183>4 dram glass vial</a> (The Container Store SKU#: 688480) securely upright to use in attempting the cleaning of my 3D printer nozzle with solvents. I had already modified <a href=http://www.thingiverse.com/lardcanoe/about>lardcanoe</a>'s <a href=http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6131>X-Acto Knife Holder</a> for use with my x-acto knife so I created a simpler but larger version for this purpose. I have converted almost all hard coded numbers to variables to make it work with the Thingiverse customizer app.
