# GlassDramHolder
An OpenSCAD design for a holder for a 4 dram glass vial. (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2252675)

I needed a base to hold a 4 dram glass vial (The Container Store SKU#: 688480 https://www.containerstore.com/s/glass-dram-vials/d?productId=10008183) securely upright to use in attempting the cleaning of my 3D printer nozzle with solvents. I had already modified lardcanoe's X-Acto Knife Holder (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6131) for use with my x-acto knife so I created a simpler but larger version for this purpose. I have converted almost all hard coded numbers to variables to make it work with the Thingiverse customizer app.
